* If you find this project useful please consider "starring" it to show your support!

## Pull requests

Pull requests are encouraged! This project builds its our own documentation, so please remember to build the documentation with [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb) before you submit your pull request! Please don't edit the readme or other docs directly, edit their respective templates instead.

### Building the docs

To build the docs, first make sure [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) is installed globally (`npm i -g verb-cli`), then just follow these simple steps:

* Edit the templates in the ['docs/' directory](./docs), and/or [.verbrc.md](./.verbrc.md)
* Run `verb` in the command line
* Pull request!

Thanks!
